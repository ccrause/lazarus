Need to pass remote tcp port number from LazDebugger to FpDbgRspClasses.
- A hack is in place for now.

Need to properly clean up break points _before_ terminating debuggee -
else connection could be lost.
- Done, called TerminateProcess.

Pause from IDE seems to get stuck in a logical loop.
- Seems fixed, but probably out of sync with the debugger state machine.

Call stack logic to be implemented.
